### New Techniques Learned

1. **Baseline Return Strategy**
   - Receive the ball behind the baseline and immediately run up
   - This allows for faster movement to reach the kitchen/non-volley zone
   - Key insight: Don't linger at the baseline after returning serve

2. **Soft Drop Shot Reading**
   - When executing a soft drop shot, observe opponent's body language
   - If opponent bends down to catch/return the ball, it indicates:
     - The drop shot was effective (low and difficult)
     - Safe opportunity to advance to the kitchen
     - Can work forward by 1-2 steps while they're recovering
   - This visual cue helps with court positioning and timing

### Practice Focus
- Continue working on baseline-to-kitchen transitions
- Practice reading opponent reactions during soft shots
- Improve timing of forward movement after successful drops

### Next Session Goals
- Work on consistency of soft drop shots
- Practice recognizing more opponent body language cues
- Focus on smooth transition movements

### New Techniques Learned

1. **Baseline Return Strategy**
   - Receive the ball behind the baseline and immediately run up
   - This allows for faster movement to reach the kitchen/non-volley zone
   - Key insight: Don't linger at the baseline after returning serve

2. **Soft Drop Shot Reading**
   - When executing a soft drop shot, observe opponent's body language
   - If opponent bends down to catch/return the ball, it indicates:
     - The drop shot was effective (low and difficult)
     - Safe opportunity to advance to the kitchen
     - Can work forward by 1-2 steps while they're recovering
   - This visual cue helps with court positioning and timing

### Practice Focus
- Continue working on baseline-to-kitchen transitions
- Practice reading opponent reactions during soft shots
- Improve timing of forward movement after successful drops

### Next Session Goals
- Work on consistency of soft drop shots
- Practice recognizing more opponent body language cues
- Focus on smooth transition movements

### New Techniques Learned

1. **Strategic Dinking**
   - Dinking is not just about getting the ball over the net
   - Target opponent's weak spots - usually left side for right-handed players
   - Add spin or slice to force difficult returns
   - Avoid "dead dinks" (easy forehand feeds to opponent)
   - When receiving dead dinks: be aggressive - smash back or use strategic lob

2. **Ready Position and Court Awareness**
   - Always maintain ready position: squatting down, agile stance
   - Stay alert and watch opponent's body language and paddle position
   - Anticipate where the ball is coming based on opponent's setup
   - Be proactive - go for the ball rather than waiting passively
   - Key insight: Reading opponent's positioning is as important as ball placement

### Practice Focus
- Work on targeted dinking to opponent's backhand/weak side
- Practice adding spin and slice to dinks
- Improve ready position consistency and court awareness
- Develop better anticipation skills by watching opponent movements

### Next Session Goals
- Focus on consistent spin/slice dinks
- Practice aggressive responses to dead dinks
- Work on maintaining proper ready position throughout rallies
- Improve reaction time and anticipation
